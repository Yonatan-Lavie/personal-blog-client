Sure, let's start writing the development documentation for Step 1: Project Setup.

# Step 1: Project Setup

## Description

In this step, we will set up the development environment, create a new React project using Create React App with TypeScript template, and remove unnecessary files and folders that come with Create React App.

## Tasks

1. Set up the development environment with Node.js and npm.
2. Create a new React project using Create React App with TypeScript template.
3. Delete unnecessary files and folders that come with Create React App.

## Detailed Steps

### Task 1: Set up the development environment with Node.js and npm.

Before starting the project setup, ensure that Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) are installed on your system. If not, you can download and install them from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/).

To verify if Node.js and npm are installed, run the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

If you see the version numbers displayed, it means Node.js and npm are installed successfully.

### Task 2: Create a new React project using Create React App with TypeScript template.

To create a new React project, we will use Create React App, which is an officially supported way to create a new React application with zero build configuration. Additionally, we will use the TypeScript template to enable TypeScript in our project.

Run the following command to create the new project:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-project --template typescript
```

Replace "my-project" with the name of your project. This command will create a new folder named "my-project" (or the name you specified) containing the boilerplate code for your React application.

### Task 3: Delete unnecessary files and folders that come with Create React App.

Once the project is created, we can safely remove some unnecessary files and folders that come with Create React App and customize our project structure.

The following files and folders can be removed:

- `src/App.css`: We'll be using styled-components for styling, so we don't need this file.
- `src/App.test.tsx`: This is a sample test file. We'll write our tests in a separate step.
- `src/logo.svg`: We don't need this SVG file as it's just a logo placeholder.
- `src/serviceWorker.ts`: We won't be using service workers in this project.

You can remove these files by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
rm src/App.css src/App.test.tsx src/logo.svg src/serviceWorker.ts
```

## Conclusion

After completing Step 1, we have successfully set up the development environment, created a new React project with TypeScript, and removed unnecessary files and folders that come with Create React App. We are now ready to move on to the next step of our project development process.
