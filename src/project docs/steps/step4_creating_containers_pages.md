2. Define the blog page layout and logic in the `Blog.tsx` file.
3. Fetch the list of blog posts from the backend API using the `api.ts` service.

### SingleBlogPost Container

1. Create the `SingleBlogPost.tsx` file in the `containers/SingleBlogPost` folder.
2. Define the single blog post page layout and logic in the `SingleBlogPost.tsx` file.
3. Fetch the full content of a single blog post from the backend API using the `api.ts` service.

### UserAuthentication Container

1. Create the `UserAuthentication.tsx` file in the `containers/UserAuthentication` folder.
2. Define the user authentication (sign-up and sign-in) page layout and logic in the `UserAuthentication.tsx` file.
3. Implement form components for sign-up and sign-in using the `SignUpForm.tsx` and `SignInForm.tsx` files in the `forms` folder.
4. Use the `authUtils.ts` from the `utils/authentication` folder to handle user authentication.

### UserProfile Container

1. Create the `UserProfile.tsx` file in the `containers/UserProfile` folder.
2. Define the user profile page layout and logic in the `UserProfile.tsx` file.
3. Fetch the user information from the backend API using the `api.ts` service.
4. Implement form component for updating the user profile using the `UserProfileForm.tsx` file in the `forms` folder.
5. Use the `fileUploadUtils.ts` from the `utils/fileUpload` folder to handle profile picture updates.

### GoldSubscription Container

1. Create the `GoldSubscription.tsx` file in the `containers/GoldSubscription` folder.
2. Define the Gold subscription page layout and logic in the `GoldSubscription.tsx` file.
3. Implement the payment form component using the `PaymentForm.tsx` file in the `components/Subscription` folder.
4. Use the `react-stripe-elements` integration for handling payments.

### VideoIntegration Container

1. Create the `VideoIntegration.tsx` file in the `containers/VideoIntegration` folder.
2. Define the video integration page layout and logic in the `VideoIntegration.tsx` file.
3. Implement video-related features using the `VideoFeature.tsx` and `VideoExplanation.tsx` components in the `components/VideoIntegration` folder.
4. Use the `videoUtils.ts` from the `utils/videoStreaming` folder to handle video integration and streaming.

### About Container

1. Create the `About.tsx` file in the `containers/About` folder.
2. Define the About page layout and logic in the `About.tsx` file.

### Contact Container

1. Create the `Contact.tsx` file in the `containers/Contact` folder.
2. Define the Contact page layout and logic in the `Contact.tsx` file.
3. Implement the contact form component using the `ContactForm.tsx` file in the `components/Footer` folder.
4. Use the `apiUtils.ts` from the `utils/apiHelpers` folder to handle form submission and API requests.

### Conclusion

In this step, we have created containers and pages for different sections of the website and implemented styled-components for each container. The containers will handle the logic and data fetching, while the components will take care of the presentation and user interface. Continue with the next steps to add more features and functionalities to your project. Happy coding!

## hendy commands

Sure! To create all the needed files for Step 4: Creating Containers and Pages, you can use the following commands:

1. Create the Home Container:

```bash
mkdir src/containers/Home
touch src/containers/Home/Home.tsx
```

2. Create the Blog Container:

```bash
mkdir src/containers/Blog
touch src/containers/Blog/Blog.tsx
```

3. Create the SingleBlogPost Container:

```bash
mkdir src/containers/SingleBlogPost
touch src/containers/SingleBlogPost/SingleBlogPost.tsx
```

4. Create the UserAuthentication Container:

```bash
mkdir src/containers/UserAuthentication
touch src/containers/UserAuthentication/UserAuthentication.tsx
```

5. Create the UserProfile Container:

```bash
mkdir src/containers/UserProfile
touch src/containers/UserProfile/UserProfile.tsx
```

6. Create the GoldSubscription Container:

```bash
mkdir src/containers/GoldSubscription
touch src/containers/GoldSubscription/GoldSubscription.tsx
```

7. Create the VideoIntegration Container:

```bash
mkdir src/containers/VideoIntegration
touch src/containers/VideoIntegration/VideoIntegration.tsx
```

8. Create the About Container:

```bash
mkdir src/containers/About
touch src/containers/About/About.tsx
```

9. Create the Contact Container:

```bash
mkdir src/containers/Contact
touch src/containers/Contact/Contact.tsx
```

10. Implement styled-components for each container:

For each container, create a corresponding .styled.ts file in the same folder. For example, for the Home container:

```bash
touch src/containers/Home/HomeStyles.ts
```

Repeat the same process for each container.

With these commands, you will create the necessary files and folders for Step 4. You can continue with the development and implementation of the logic and styling for each container as described in the step.
