**Step 5: Handling Redux State**

1. **Set up Redux with Redux Toolkit**

To handle the application's state management, we will use Redux with Redux Toolkit, which provides a set of utilities to simplify the Redux setup and streamline the development process.

First, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
```

2. **Create the user feature in the features/user folder**

Create a new folder named "user" inside the "features" directory:

```
src/
|-- features/
|   |-- user/
```

3. **Create the posts feature in the features/posts folder**

Create a new folder named "posts" inside the "features" directory:

```
src/
|-- features/
|   |-- posts/
```

4. **Create the comments feature in the features/comments folder**

Create a new folder named "comments" inside the "features" directory:

```
src/
|-- features/
|   |-- comments/
```

5. **Define the Redux slices, actions, and thunks for each feature**

In each feature directory (user, posts, comments), create three files: `<featureName>Slice.ts`, `<featureName>Actions.ts`, and `<featureName>Thunks.ts`. For example, in the "user" feature:

```
src/
|-- features/
|   |-- user/
|   |   |-- userSlice.ts
|   |   |-- userActions.ts
|   |   |-- userThunks.ts
```
