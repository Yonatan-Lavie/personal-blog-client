Great! Let's continue with the development documentation for Step 2: Project Structure and Initial Setup.

# Step 2: Project Structure and Initial Setup

## Description

In this step, we will create the project structure with directories for components, containers, pages, features, services, utils, forms, and other necessary folders. Additionally, we will set up the `theme.ts` file in the root directory to define theme configurations and global styles, and the `types.ts` file in the `utils` directory to define TypeScript typings for shared types.

## Tasks

1. Create the project structure with directories for components, containers, pages, features, services, utils, forms, and other necessary folders.
2. Set up the `theme.ts` file in the root directory to define theme configurations and global styles.
3. Set up the `types.ts` file in the `utils` directory to define TypeScript typings for shared types.

## Detailed Steps

### Task 1: Create the project structure with necessary directories.

To organize our project, we'll create the following directories:

- `src/components`: For reusable UI components.
- `src/containers`: For container components (smart components with business logic).
- `src/pages`: For page components.
- `src/features`: For Redux Toolkit feature slices.
- `src/services`: For API and socket interactions.
- `src/utils`: For utility functions and shared types.
- `src/forms`: For form components.

Run the following commands in your terminal to create these directories:

```bash
mkdir -p src/components src/containers src/pages src/features src/services src/utils src/forms
```

### Task 2: Set up the `theme.ts` file in the root directory.

The `theme.ts` file will be used to define theme configurations, such as colors, fonts, breakpoints, and global styles using styled-components.

Create a new file named `theme.ts` in the root directory of your project. Add the following content to define your theme:

```typescript
// theme.ts
const theme = {
  colors: {
    primary: '#007bff',
    secondary: '#6c757d',
    // Add more color variables as needed.
  },
  fonts: {
    main: 'Arial, sans-serif',
    // Add more font variables as needed.
  },
  breakpoints: {
    mobile: '576px',
    tablet: '768px',
    desktop: '992px',
    // Add more breakpoint variables as needed.
  },
};

export default theme;
```

### Task 3: Set up the `types.ts` file in the `utils` directory.

The `types.ts` file will be used to define TypeScript typings for shared types used throughout the project.

Create a new file named `types.ts` in the `utils` directory. Add the following content to define shared types:

```typescript
// utils/types.ts
export interface User {
  id: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  email: string;
  // Add more user-related fields as needed.
}

// Add more shared types as needed.
```

## Conclusion

After completing Step 2, we have set up the project structure with directories for components, containers, pages, features, services, utils, forms, and other necessary folders. Additionally, we have defined theme configurations and global styles in the `theme.ts` file and defined TypeScript typings for shared types in the `types.ts` file. Our project is now organized and ready for further development. We can proceed to the next step of our project development process.
