project structure and explain the purpose of each one:

1. `assets/`:

   - Purpose: This directory is meant to store static assets such as images, fonts, or other media files used in the application.

2. `components/`:

   - Purpose: This directory holds reusable React components that can be used across different parts of the application.

3. `containers/`:

   - Purpose: The container components, also known as "smart" components, are responsible for handling business logic and data manipulation. They can be connected to the Redux store and manage the state of the application.

4. `forms/`:

   - Purpose: This directory contains form components that are used for user input, data submission, and validation. They can be used in different parts of the application that require form functionalities.

5. `pages/`:

   - Purpose: Each page component represents a specific page of the application, typically corresponding to a specific route. These components act as the main content for each route and may consist of multiple reusable components.

6. `features/`:

   - Purpose: The `features` directory follows the Redux Toolkit approach of organizing the state into "features" or "slices." Each feature slice contains the Redux slice files for a specific feature of the application, such as users, posts, or comments.

7. `services/`:

   - Purpose: This directory contains services used for interacting with external APIs, sockets, or other external data sources.

8. `utils/`:

   - Purpose: The `utils` directory is for utility files and shared functions that can be used across different parts of the application. It may contain TypeScript typings, helper functions, and other utility code.

9. `theme.js`:

   - Purpose: This file defines the theme and styles using styled-components. It can include color schemes, fonts, and other styling-related configurations.

10. `App.tsx`:

    - Purpose: The main entry point of the application. It renders the top-level components and sets up the routing.

11. `index.tsx`:

    - Purpose: The entry point of the application for rendering the root component (`App`) into the DOM.

12. `store.ts`:

    - Purpose: The configuration file for creating the Redux store using the Redux Toolkit.

13. `routes.tsx`:

    - Purpose: This file defines the routing configuration for the application, mapping URL paths to specific page components.

14. `*.styles.ts` files:
    - Purpose: These files contain styled-components specific to the components or containers they correspond to. They separate the styling from the component logic, improving code readability and maintainability.

With this organization, your project follows a modular and maintainable structure. Reusable components are separated from business logic in containers. Redux state management is organized into feature slices, and utility functions and typings are stored in the `utils` directory. The project is ready to support TypeScript, providing type safety and improving code quality and scalability.

plan for building the project, broken down into steps that correspond to the files needing development:

**Step 1: Project Setup**
